# Exercise 1.7
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with 
# Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. The 
# interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.

# Exercise 1.8
# Suppose Dave pays an extra $1000/month for the first 12 months of the mortgage?
# Modify the program to incorporate this extra payment and have it print the 
# total amount paid along with the number of months required.
#
#When you run the new program, it should report a total payment of 929,965.62 over 342 months.

# Exercise 1.9
# Modify the program so that extra payment information can be more generally 
# handled. Make it so that the user can set these variables:
#
# extra_payment_start_month = 61
# extra_payment_end_month = 108
# extra_payment = 1000
#
# Make the program look at these variables and calculate the total paid appropriately.
#
# How much will Dave pay if he pays an extra $1000/month for 4 years starting 
# after the first five years have already been paid?
